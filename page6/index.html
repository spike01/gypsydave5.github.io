    <span class="post-date">07 Jul 2014</span>

    <p>Adding to my list of <a href="/2014/07/04/surviving_windows/">ways to fix the Windows experience</a>, I have to
pay due respect to <a href="http://blog.kowalczyk.info/">Krystoff Kowalcyzk</a>, a developer who
has ported <a href="http://geoff.greer.fm/2011/12/27/the-silver-searcher-better-than-ack/">Ag (aka The Silver Surfer)</a> over to Windows. He&#39;s also authored
a really elegant (and for elegant please read lightweight and customizable)
PDF viewer <a href="http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/free-pdf-reader.html">SumatraPDF</a>. Both of these have improved my life today.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been looking at alternatives to Adobe Reader on the Ubuntu box as well -
currently I&#39;m enjoying the simplicity of <a href="http://www.mupdf.com/">muPDF</a>, but there are many
other options out there.</p>

        Surviving Windows
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Jul 2014</span>

    <p>I&#39;ve worked within Windows and Microsoft OSs for... well, most of my computing
life now I think about it. I&#39;m pretty sure that most people are the same. And
like most people I&#39;ve always had my little moans about it. Too many to mention.</p>

<p>This has come to a head since I [switched to Linux][LinuxSwitch] a few months
ago. Not that Linux (Ubuntu in my case) doesn&#39;t have it&#39;s own long list of
problems, but they all feel more like problems I should be fixing myself
- rather than things I&#39;ll just moan about and put up with. Yes, Ubuntu (and the
Unity desktop specfically) has &#39;spoiled&#39; me. I&#39;d rather be working in that
environment than any earlier version of Windows. Woo-hoo. Hear the whoop from camp
Linux, joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, etc etc usw.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s still so much of my life that has to be done in Windows. Work
spreadsheet has VBA macros? Work machine in Vista? <a href="https://launchpad.net/pipelight">Netflix requires
Silverlight</a>? It&#39;s inevitable.</p>

<p>So instead of moaning I&#39;ve been trying to fix Windows to make it usable like
I want it to be. And I think I&#39;ve found some good options. The first thing to
note is that I&#39;ve been so used to putting up with Windows that I was under the
impression that there was very little that could be done to it. Lay that thought
to rest - there&#39;s hundreds of hacks, options, fixes, and bits of software we can
use to make Window&#39;s a happier place to be. Or, if not actively happy, then at
least survivable...</p>

<h2>Winsplit Revolution</h2>

<p>OK, not the greatest name. What I missed most about Ubuntu when stuck on Vista
was the way I could throw windows around the desktop using the numpad. This
feauture is neatly emulated with <a href="http://download.cnet.com/WinSplit-Revolution/3000-2072_4-10971915.html">Winsplit Revolution</a>, which is small
and, well, works. You can customize the shortcuts too. (Looks like the original
website is no longer around so I&#39;ve linked to the CNET page).</p>

<h2>Put the taskbar on the side</h2>

<p>Oh this sounds dumb I know, but nobody even thinks of doing it on Windows
because it&#39;s a change. Totally inspired by the Unity set up, it just makes more
sense. If most of what I&#39;m doing involves reading down a page on the screen
- code, text, etc - then I really want optimize the vertical space on the
screen. So slam the taskbar to the side and get yourself a couple of centimeters
for free. If you were going to try one new thing this week make it this.</p>

<h2>GVim</h2>

<p>All that Vim goodness - <a href="http://www.vim.org/download.php#pc">now on your Windows</a>. And you can use the same
config files. And you can set the config depending on the environment (Windows,
Linux, OSX). And you could save all those files onto Dropbox, make symlinks to
them... OK - too far. But get GVim for Windows.</p>

<h2>Autohotkey</h2>

<p>I&#39;ll write something about the what effect of removing the caps lock button from
my keyboard has been (no, not physically) at a later date. But for fun keyboard
hacks like this and more I&#39;ve been enjoying <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/">Autohotkey</a>, which has its
own simple scripting language to allow you to remap and rewite your keyboard to
your hearts content.</p>

<h2>Get GNUy</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve tried <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> before - part of working using a Linux only font
tool. But I found it... big. Powerful, yes - but big. So big I didn&#39;t use it.
Second time around I&#39;ve been using <a href="https://github.com/bmatzelle/gow/wiki">Gow</a> - which brings all the *nix-y
command line goodness to your <code>cmd</code> shell in Windows.</p>

<h2>Chocolatey</h2>

<p>Missing <code>apt-get</code> or similar package management utilities on Windows?
<a href="http://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a> to the rescue. Install Git! Install Node! Install
everything listed above and more, and get them all updated from the command
line. It&#39;s brilliant.</p>

<p>Ah, that&#39;s it for now. All I&#39;d finish off by saying is that the only thing
holding me back from improving my experience of Windows was... ignorance. And
indolence. GNU/Linux makes you change things to fit the way you work, and as soon as
you&#39;ve learned how to do that it&#39;s easier to avoide complacence with other OSes.
. A good lesson.</p>

        Interview at 'My Linux Rig'
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 Jul 2014</span>

    <p>A few months ago Steven Ovadia over at <a href="http://www.mylinuxrig.com/">My Linux Rig</a> spotted my post
about <a href="/2014/04/29/late-in-the-day-linux/">the night I installed Linux</a> and asked me if I&#39;d like to do a quick
interview about, well, about my Linux setup. Sounded like a good idea so
I answered his questions. He posted <a href="http://www.mylinuxrig.com/post/90468057902/the-linux-setup-david-wickes-software-developer">the interview</a> today and
if you&#39;d like to look at it.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s any amendments that need to be made now that I&#39;ve been using Linux
for, oh, about 20 times as long as I had been, it would have to be that I find
myself wrestling with the system more - but in a good way. I know that I can
make it do the things I want it to if I just invest a bit of time and effort to
find out how. Linux doesn&#39;t make me &#39;put up and shut up&#39; - it actively
encourages me to fix things, make it suit me. This sort of experimentation and
investigation takes time, but it&#39;s ultimately very rewarding - I know my way
around my Linux machine better than my Windows set up.</p>

<p>In addition I rarely touch ST3 any more, spending most of my editing time on
Vim as <a href="/2014/06/14/vimmified/">previously mentioned</a>. And Guake lost its novelty rapidly. Right now I&#39;m
sifting through five years of Gmail using <a href="http://www.mutt.org/">Mutt</a>. Now that&#39;s something.
And using <a href="http://irssi.org/">irssi</a> to dip my toe into the community with IRC.</p>

<p>Probably the most affecting bit is to see the phrase &#39;David Wickes, Software
Developer&#39; at the top. I&#39;m not a software developer - yet. But I will be soon.
And reading that, well, it made me feel pretty good about myself. Something to
aspire to.</p>

    <span class="post-date">14 Jun 2014</span>

    <p>I&#39;m not sure why I&#39;ve started to use Vim obsessively over the last week - there
are a number of factors feeding in, mostly centred around my perverse need to do
make something more difficult than is strictly necessary; I&#39;m learning Vim
&quot;Because it&#39;s there&quot;...</p>

<p>That&#39;s not strictly true - if I&#39;m going to blame something it&#39;s going to be
Windows Vista. Or, more speifically, the way Windows Vista insists on
sporadically freezing my mouse for 10-20 seconds every fifteen minutes or so.
It starts to add up, killing the flow of the work and slowing me down no end.</p>

<p>So I discovered <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en">Vimium</a>, an extension for Chromium that puts all the
Vim keys into the browser. If you&#39;ve used the shortcut keys in Twitter you&#39;ll be
right at home (the same with Gmail&#39;s shortcuts but slightly less so). It&#39;s not
only let me circumvent my mouse when it freezes; I&#39;ve found myself using it in
preference to the mouse in most cases, fingers sitting happily on the home keys
as I navigate around the web, mostly without any hold ups. Even if you don&#39;t
think you&#39;ll use it it&#39;s worth installing just to see the way it implements link
clicking.</p>

<p>So having got this far it felt churlish not to go and install Vim, by way of the
Windows build of <a href="http://www.vim.org/download.php">Gvim</a>. Now, while I&#39;m trying to wean myself off Windows
(made much easier by having a Vista box at work), I am still forced to use it
(oh that Vista box at work). I&#39;d been happy up to now with <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text
3</a>, which I have synced across all my computers and which also implements
a <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/vintage.html">&#39;Vintage&#39;</a> (should that be &#39;Vimtage&#39;) mode with a most of the Vim
commands intact. But it&#39;s always worth trying new things I figured, and getting
Vim going nicely on Windows seemed like a fun challenge.</p>

<p>Challenge it was. I love the Sublime Text <a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/">Package Manager</a>, which
beautifully lists and installs packages from Sublime Text itself. Very cool.
Looking for something similar in Vim I found <a href="https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim/wiki/Vundle-for-Windows">Vundle</a>, which installs
Vim packages directly from Github, locally, or almost anywhere, when they&#39;re
listed in the <code>.vimrc</code> configuration file. Like everything in the open-source
community it&#39;s all geared up for *nix systems, so takes <a href="https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim/wiki/Vundle-for-Windows">a little bit of
tweaking</a> to get going on Windows.</p>

<p>Even more tweaking was required when I decided to take a great leap forward and
put <a href="https://github.com/zaiste/vimified">Vimified</a> on as well, a starting collection of packages for Vim.
Which of course was also <a href="http://kaszkowiak.eu/windows-vimified/">fraught on Windows</a>. But ultimately
successful (even if I did seem to spend at least three days getting the
<a href="https://github.com/bling/vim-airline">Airline/Powerline</a> status bar fonts working).</p>

<p>Half the fun of this little project has been learning how to edit the .vimrc
file - and by extension all *nix config files. More confidence at the command
line can only be a good thing, and a good poke around the workings of Linux has
made me feel a little more confident (even so far as to getting the
<a href="https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline">Powerline</a> fonts working in Bash).</p>

<p>What strikes me as I write this (in Vim - but on the Linux box at home) about
a month on is how swiftly the Vim keys have worked themselves into my average
workflow. I find it faster to open new lines, append lines, and navigate with
J/K than arrows.  Combined with Alt-Tabbing between windows, and Vimium in the
browser, I haven&#39;t touched the mouse in creating this document - including all
the copy-pasting of links. I haven&#39;t even left the home keys.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not quite happy to leave Sublime Text yet - but I&#39;m certainly seeing my way there.</p>

        A Pair of Podcasts
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 May 2014</span>

    <p>Trying to bootstrap myself into software development is a struggle. A struggle
with some successes - I mean, let&rsquo;s not forget that I&#39;m writing this in
markdown using vim using jekyll to create a static site that&rsquo;s being
hosted with GitHub Pages; a few months ago I wouldn&rsquo;t have known what that
meant. But a struggle none the less.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always found immersion to be key to being able to get my head around
a subject - just hammering away until it starts to make sense. A great help in
all of this has been a pair of fantastic podcasts from Envylabs, <a href="http://five-js.envylabs.com/"><em>Five Minutes
of JavaScript</em></a> and <a href="http://ruby5.envylabs.com/"><em>Ruby 5</em></a> (it was only when I came to Google
&ldquo;JavaScript 5&rdquo; that it became clear why they went with the
convoluted title...).</p>

<p>Both podcasts are short - seven minutes max - and just list down anything
that&rsquo;s going on with the two languages at the moment. They&rsquo;re
broadcast twice weekly, keeping the information fresh and pertinent. At first
I had very little idea what was going on - technologies I&rsquo;d never heard of
doing things I couldn&rsquo;t understand, updates, new &#39;gems&#39;... all a bit of
a mystery.</p>

<p>But the short format, and regular broadcasts, encouraged listening. I can catch
up in five minutes when waiting for a train, walking the dog, popping to the
shops. And it&rsquo;s started to pay off; I now understand about 70% of what&#39;s
going on in each episode, and I&#39;m using the technologies they talk about (like
jekyll).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried other podcasts and audios - chiefly lecture series from some of
America&#39;s great institutions such as Harvard&#39;s <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-cs50x-introduction-computer-1022#.U30fhR_Hk8o">CS50</a> course available
from <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-cs50x-introduction-computer-1022#.U30fhR_Hk8o">EdX</a>, and Stanford&#39;s <a href="http://see.stanford.edu/see/courseinfo.aspx?coll=824a47e1-135f-4508-a5aa-866adcae1111">Programming Methodology</a> course
(which I enjoy a lot). While these broad academic courses are both informative
and entertaining, and helpful, I&#39;m still not at the point where the subjects
unders discussion are anything more than reinforcement to my study of Ruby and
JavaScript. I&#39;m sure it will also click into place eventually, much like the
Envylabs podcasts.</p>

<p>It&#39;s worth mentioning the player I&#39;m using too - <a href="https://player.fm/">Player FM</a> is maybe
the best thing I&#39;ve ever used to play a podcast. Does everything you want, does
nothing you don&#39;t and sits on the phone occasionally telling you when there&#39;s
a new episode.</p>
