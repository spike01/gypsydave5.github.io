        Bitwise and Permission
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">16 Aug 2014</span>

    <p>So I thought I&#39;d try and write about what happened last day of the first week at
<a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/">Makers</a>, as mentioned in <a href="/2014/08/09/makers-day-five/">my last post</a>, about the failing RSpec test for
the Unix task. Just because I learned a lot about both permissions on a Unix
like system, about bitwise operators in Ruby, about how RSpec works, and how
(not) to fix things.</p>

<p>So... the test checking file permissions in a directory by running the following
RSpec test.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">  <span class="n">it</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Should only allow the owner to change into my/private/files&quot;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="n">folder</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;my/private/files&quot;</span>
    <span class="n">permissions</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">File</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">stat</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">folder</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">mode</span>
    <span class="n">expect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">permissions</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="mo">0000100</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">be_true</span>
    <span class="n">expect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">permissions</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="mo">0000010</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">eq</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">expect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">permissions</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="mo">0000001</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">eq</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>When we first ran it, it failed on the first expectation above - even though we
knew that the file had the right permissions. So what was going on - both in
terms of how it was meant to work, and why it wasn&#39;t working?</p>

<h2>Permissions</h2>

<p>Let&#39;s start with that first expectation.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">expect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">permissions</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="mo">0000100</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">be_true</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><code>permissions</code> is a variable representing the result of <code>File.stat(folder).mode</code>,
where <code>folder</code> is the directory being checked. The <code>mode</code> method <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/File/Stat.html#method-i-mode">returns the
permissions-bits of the Unix <code>stat</code> command</a> - which you can take
a look at in detail with a quick <code>man stat -a</code> (as it&#39;s <code>stat(2)</code> you&#39;re looking
at.</p>

<p>What does all this mean? It means that we&#39;re getting back an integer which
represents the current permissions on the file. And how does an integer
represent permissions? If you&#39;ve been using <code>chmod</code> to change permission with
commands like <code>chmod go-w filename</code> (remove write from group and others), well
- you&#39;ve been missing a trick and a whole lot of fun.</p>

<p>The fun way to set permission is using the <em>absolute mode</em>, which sets the
permissions absolutely every time you use it (rather than relatively removing or
adding them from the current state - see <code>man chmod</code> for more). There are three
settings (read, write and execute) for each of the three permissions groups
(user, group, other) on a file. Each of those permissions sets is represented
by a single octal digit (from 1 to 7), and the settings are literally added to
each one - the setting for read is 4, write is 2 and execute is 1.</p>

<p>Any combination of these numbers will produce a unique number - read + write
= 6, write + execute = 3, just read = 4. And you can combine them into
a three-digit octal number which represents the file permissions for any given
file, where the first digit is user, the second is group and the third is other.</p>

<p>In practice: <code>chmod 777</code> gives permissions for everything. <code>chmod 644</code> gives
read/write to user, and just read to group and other. <code>755</code> is
read/write/execute for user, and just read/execute for the group and other.</p>

<h2>The science &quot;bit&quot;</h2>

<p>Notice how none of the octal numbers ever &#39;carry&#39; over to the next one when
they&#39;re added together? This is a piece of computer science wizzardry - because
they&#39;re in octal, I can look at them as both an actual integer or as a series of
switches (or maybe dials), setting permissions for each permissions group up and
down. Thing is, for your computer, these two ways of looking at it <em>are exactly
the same</em>.</p>

<p><code>777</code> in decimal notation is <code>511</code> (do the maths if you like), but also has
a binary representation of... <code>111111111</code>. Hey, look - all the 1s! It&#39;s like all
the switches are turned on - and they really are!. This is because octal digits
map really neatly to binary digits - they&#39;re a three-digit long collection of
binary digits. &#39;Binary digit&#39; is a bit of a mouthful (pun intended), so let&#39;s
use the shorthand word - bit. Each set of three bits represents one of the
permission statuses for a particular permissions set. So the first three 1s
above are the permissions for the user, and in particular the first one is the
read, second write and the third the execute - all set to 1 or &#39;on&#39;.</p>

<p>(Experiment in a Ruby repl like pry or irb - you can switch between binary,
octal and decimal really quickly in Ruby. Any integer you type in with a leading
<code>0</code> (say <code>0777</code>) will automatically be translated as an octal (<code>0777</code> will
return <code>511</code> - the decimal representation). And you can flip to a binary
representation with <code>to_s(2)</code> - the <code>(2)</code> setting the base of the conversion, so
that <code>0777.to_s(2)</code> will return <code>&quot;111111111&quot;</code>. Try some other numbers!)</p>

<p>So when <code>mode</code> returns an integer, it&#39;s the integer that represents the current
permissions on that file - a file with read, write and exeute permissions for
all the sets would give you the number <code>511</code> (which is the same as <code>777</code> and
<code>111111111</code>).</p>

<h2>Bitwise</h2>

<p>Now we get to the fun stuff - <code>permissions &amp; 0000100</code>. What&#39;s the <code>&amp;</code> doing? And
those leading 0s? As mentioned above, the leading zeroes are just Ruby&#39;s way of
saying that this number is in octal. So (repls open) <code>0000100</code> just becomes
<code>64</code>. But the thing doing the work here is <code>&amp;</code> - not our friendly Boolean <code>&amp;&amp;</code>,
but a differnent beast - this is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND"><strong>bitwise AND</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Bitwise operators, of which <code>&amp;</code> is an example, really tear the lid off the
computer and get a little bit closer to the bare metal. Computers aren&#39;t made of
objects, or lines of code, strings and integers. They&#39;re made of 0s and 1s. And
bitwise operators work on 0s and 1s - or, specifically, binary numbers.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a pair of binary numbers, say <code>111</code> and <code>100</code> (known to you and me as
7 and 4). Bitwise AND compares the bit in each position, and asks the question
&quot;are you both <code>1</code>?&quot; If they are, you get a <code>1</code>, otherwise it&#39;s a <code>0</code>. So <code>111
&amp; 100</code> will return <code>100</code> as the third bit (counting from the right) is the only
one that matches in each number</p>

<p>(Think of it just like a regular logical AND - but <code>1</code> is <code>true</code> and <code>0</code> is
<code>false</code> - running on each bit position.)</p>

<p>We now have enough knowledge to look at the test again</p>

<h2>Back to the test</h2>

<p>To recap, the test looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">  <span class="n">it</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Should only allow the owner to change into my/private/files&quot;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="n">folder</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;my/private/files&quot;</span>
    <span class="n">permissions</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">File</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">stat</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">folder</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">mode</span>
    <span class="n">expect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">permissions</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="mo">0000100</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">be_true</span>
    <span class="n">expect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">permissions</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="mo">0000010</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">eq</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">expect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">permissions</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="mo">0000001</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">eq</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The key line being:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">expect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">permissions</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="mo">0000100</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">be_true</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now let&#39;s pretend that the directory currently has permissions of <code>700</code> - read,
write and execute (&#39;execute&#39; is &#39;open&#39; for a folder -- allowing you to <code>cd</code> into
it). We run <code>mode</code> on it and get the permissions integer back - in octal, that&#39;s
<code>700</code> again. We then run a bitwise AND - the <code>&amp;</code> against it using the octal
number <code>100</code> (all those <code>0</code>s at the beginning are just saying &#39;hey! I&#39;m octal!&#39;
to Ruby).</p>

<p>Converting octal to binary, <code>700</code> is <code>111000000</code>, and <code>100</code> is <code>1000000</code> (Don&#39;t
trust me? Fire up a repl!). Maybe think of <code>1000000</code> as <code>001000000</code> for the next
bit. Comparing the two binary numbers, the only place they match is at the
seventh bit - and so we get <code>1000000</code> as the returned value. Which, in octal is
<code>100</code> and in decimal is <code>64</code>.</p>

<p>The neat thing about this is that it will return <code>64</code> for any permission set
that includes user executable permission on a file - <code>700</code>, <code>500</code>, <code>177</code>, <code>355</code>,
<code>777</code> -- they <em>all</em> work. Say we&#39;ve got <code>355</code> - in binary that&#39;s <code>011101101</code>.
<code>&amp;</code>ing it with <code>001000000</code> again will give us... <code>001000000</code> again - hey, it&#39;s
<code>64</code>! Try it with as many numbers as you like.</p>

<p>The other two tests are to check whether the Group or Other sets also have
execute permission -- that&#39;s <code>010</code> becoming <code>000001000</code> and <code>001</code> to
<code>000000001</code>, bitwised against the permissions making sure they <em>don&#39;t</em> have that
bit set. They come out as <code>0</code> -- no matches!</p>

<p>And so that&#39;s how it all hangs together. But why didn&#39;t it work? Simply put
everyone on the course had just installed the latest version of RSpec, and
<code>be_true</code> is not in the latest version&#39;s syntax. So all we needed to do was
change <code>be_true</code> over to <code>eq(64)</code> and it would&#39;ve been fixed.</p>

<p>Of course, that&#39;s not what we <em>actually</em> did. What we did was hack around until
it worked, and even then we ended up with <code>is_not eq(0)</code> instead of the neater
(and more correct) answer of <code>eq(64)</code>. It was only when thinking about it over
the weekend that I really got a handle on what was going on</p>

        Makers: day 5
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">09 Aug 2014</span>

    <p>I thought I&#39;d be writing a blog post everyday about my experience at
<a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/">Makers</a>. Or at least every two days. That went out of the window pretty
damn quickly. Things move quickly, so let&#39;s go for a quick update and review
before I get along with my Saturday...</p>

<h2>Day -2</h2>

<p>Headed to the graduation of the cohort 12 weeks ahead of ours and met some of
the guys joining me in the August group, as well as the &#39;seniors&#39; (that&#39;s
seniors by a full 6 weeks -- I don&#39;t thinks they&#39;ll be taking my lunch money).
Got to see the different final projects that had been created -- really
beautiful stuff such as the artist portfolio site, and a fun way to work out
which film to watch with your friends using the IMDB API. I was struck with how
polished these projects looked - fleshed out and beautiful.</p>

<h2>Day 0</h2>

<p>First day. Start early and meet everyone. We all introduce each other with
interesting facts (much antipathy towards mushrooms), and the Makers team do the
same. Many of the names have sinces wondered off into the sunset of my memory,
but we&#39;re mainly being taught by <a href="https://github.com/ecomba">Enrique</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Stephen_lloyd">Stephen</a> and <a href="https://github.com/roidriscoll">Roi</a> who&#39;s the TA
(and who has <em>only just finished the course</em> -- amazing) at the moment.</p>

<p>Our first challenge is to get set up and create a web app that generates
motivational posters from a Google image search. In one day. And, amazingly, we
all manage it. There&#39;s some pretty hairy moments to begin with (imagine a room
full of people all downloading the same software at the same time using the same
WiFi). But it happens.</p>

<p>I asked Enrique whether I should stick with the Linux laptop or try out one of
the MacBook Pros the Makers kindly offer for students to borrow during the
course. He used to use Linux himself but was converted in a single day having
borrowed a friend&#39;s. So I thought I&#39;d try it out...</p>

<p>I&#39;m typing this on the Mac. Enough said.</p>

<h2>Day 1</h2>

<p>And it&#39;s straight into the first project - creating a student directory for our
cohort using Ruby and the command line. We&#39;re all at different levels of
experience at the moment - I&#39;d describe myself as confident with a CLI and Ruby
having prepared (over-prepared?) extensively for the last few... months (I was
just looking at GitHub and I&#39;ve been pushing there since February. Time flies!).
The exercises are kept as a text document on GitHub with links to pills on how
to use Git and the Unix command line. I pair with <a href="https://github.com/flickoid">Chris</a> who I&#39;d met on the
open day. We have a great time getting through the work.</p>

<h2>Day 2</h2>

<p>There are lectures throughout the day -- one in the morning and one in the
afternoon -- with additional talks during the day from other people coming in to
the building. Today was the turn of the technology heads from <a href="http://www.typematrix.com/">Compare the
Market.com</a> to talk to us. It was interesting to hear them talk about
how their technology and culture had chnged over the last ten years, especially
the shift to an Agile culture. The more I hear and read about Agile the more
excited it makes me feel about working as a programmer - not just writing code
but having a wide-ranging input into what is being developed. It was also cool
to hear the coders described as being, essentially, &#39;customer-facing&#39; -- that
they were the closest staff memebers to actual customer experience and so were
expectd to both feedback as such, generate ideas, and importantly care for the
web app all the time, with flexible working hours. I&#39;d never thought of it that
way, but in a world where a company&#39;s only contact with their customers is
through the web, coders become the customer facing members of staff with all th
responsibility that entails.</p>

<p>We also get talks from the cohort above us -- the seniors. It&#39;s great seeing
these guys wanting to pass on the knowledge, the hints, the tricks -- everything
they&#39;ve picked up in the last few weeks, on to us. This tradition started
spontaneously but fits so well with the ethos of Makers. I&#39;m looking forward to
maybe doing one myself.</p>

<p>Erique talks about his keyboard layout for five minutes today -- well maybe more
than five minutes. Not only is he a Vi(m) weezard but he also uses (1) COLMAC
layout on both (2) the MacBook if he&#39;s out and about or (3) the <a href="http://www.typematrix.com/">scariest
keyboard in the world</a> if he&#39;s wanting to type a lot.</p>

<p>Vim is enough for me, although Andy in our cohort borrows the keyboard for a day
and starts to learn COLMAC. Brave.</p>

<h2>Day 3</h2>

<p>I&#39;m ahead. A few of us are ahead. In fact a few of us are wondering why we&#39;re
not useing OOP methods to write this code because, frankly, it&#39;s looking a bit
messy right now. My code is particularly awful until [Ben] and I chat about it
and he suggests refactoring to make more but shorter methods with much better
names. I kick myself -- I knew that! -- but bad habits die hard.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t mind being ahead -- I&#39;m not straining at the bit. At the beginning
Enrique and Stephen said that we&#39;re as strong as our weakest member, and that we
should never leave a man behind. I think of my cohort as a team, and I&#39;m
responsible. So I float around answering questions and trying to help out where
I can. I had a great moment in the morning with <a href="https://github.com/ruthearle">Ruth</a> in which we both learned
new things about symbols, and I&#39;ve enjoyed speaking to <a href="https://github.com/silver-io">Javier</a> about -- well
lots of things. We have pretty similar motivations for getting in to Makers; we
both want a better, more fulfilling work life. I&#39;m more sure now that I&#39;ve found
it.</p>

<p>And I like talking about code! I hadn&#39;t realised that this is what I was missing
so much. Talking and working everyday in Ruby has increased my confidence and my
knowledge. Helping others helps yourself, teachers learn more from their
students. The last time I felt this way was at University, and it&#39;s a great
feeling.</p>

<p>Stephen and Roi introduce the finer points of using Git today in a fantastic
lecture. I&#39;ve found myself getting tangled up in my own branches so much that it
was good to have things explained carefully and accurately, and with
a demonstration as well. I learned a lot.</p>

<h2>Day 4</h2>

<p>Test Driven Developmet (TDD) drops with a bang today as Enrique and Stephen
introduce <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a> and a completely different way of writing code. Really.
I&#39;d heard of TDD, I&#39;d heard people moan about or praise it -- but I&#39;d not
seen it until Enrique started hammering away at Vim on the projector to create
<a href="https://ithub.com/gypsydave5/fizzbuzz">FizzBuzz</a> by first defining what the code ought to be doing and then making it
do it, then expanding the spec&#39;, making the code fail, making the code pass,
expanding the spec&#39;... repeat, rinse... it was amazing. He hooked it up with the
idea of both the scientific method and a good doctor washing their hands. And it
made sense -- declaring where you&#39;re going and then getting there, rather than
just blindly, messily, hacking around until something drops out.</p>

<p>We should be able to repeat these steps, write a FizzBuzz implementation using
TDD, in less that five minutes. My first try was 33. I think it&#39;s a great way to
practice.</p>

<p>We also had a talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/rubenkostucki">Reuben</a> and Sam who both work to get Makers students
placements when they graduate. It was a really good idea to have them introduce
themselves and talk about what we could do to make their lives (and so our lives)
easier. Which boiled down to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pair. A Lot.</li>
<li>Always TDD. Always.</li>
<li>Push often and always to GitHub.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t worry about the job. Do the course.</li>
</ol>

<p>Which was a load off everyone&#39;s mind.</p>

<p>The Friday Challenge was CLI based, so I waltzed blithly through (and had
a really good time remembering some fun commands). Excitingly it was marked with
an RSpec file which checked whether your changes &#39;passed&#39; -- literally.
Unfortunately the file was written in an earlier version of the RSpec syntax and
so the tests failed even when they should&#39;ve passed. So <a href="https://github.com/spike01">Spike</a> and I got to do
our own Friday Challenge and fix the RSpec file. I say challenge -- we made more
of a mountain out of that molehill than maybe we should&#39;ve, but we learned a lot
about octal, binary, Unix permissions and bitwise operators on the way, as well as Rspec.</p>

<p>Mulling over what was going on with <code>permissions &amp; 0000100</code> while leaning on
a beanbag, talking the problem through with a new friend while drinking a cold
beer at six-thirty on a Friday, I felt happier than I have in years. In the last
week I&#39;ve literally eaten and slept code (I dreamed in Ruby one night. It was
odd) almost every hour of the day. And I love it.</p>

        One week to go
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Jul 2014</span>

    <p>For those who know me, or have been following my <a href="https://twitter.com/gypsydave5">Twitter feed</a>, you may
know that I&#39;ll be starting at <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/">Makers Academy</a> on the 4th of August.
That&#39;s in a week&#39;s time. Part of the reason I&#39;ve been keeping this blog is to
monitor my progress in preparing for that day.</p>

<p>So, why Makers?</p>

<p>My New Year&#39;s resolution was to change my life (aren&#39;t they always?). I didn&#39;t
want to spend the next thirty-plus years working in a career I was adequately
suited for (marketing) and being the guy in the department who got to do all the
maths-y/computery stuff while not being at all enthusiastic about... well, about
everything else he was doing. At the time I was having a terrible time in my job</p>

<p>I sought advice from everyone I knew, and talked incessantly about software
development with anyone who would listen. I&#39;m blessed with good, patient friends
who were happy to put up with this, a number of who work in the industry
already. They&#39;ve steered me and mentored me over the last few months
(specifically <a href="https://twitter.com/shapeshed">@shapeshed</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/asbrookes">@asbrookes</a>), shown me where
<a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">codecademy</a> was, and generally answered any of my questions.  I recognised
that this career change was going to work - the more I learned the more I wanted
to learn, and the more there was to learn the more a learned (a happy virtuous
circle). An interest in tech and programming became a passion (my partner can
attest to this - barely an evening without being glued to the laptop, tapping
away).  I became confident in my decision.</p>

<p>I mentioned my intentions to my friend Mike. &quot;Oh,&quot; he said, &quot;sort of like what
<a href="https://twitter.com/jamesjoshuahill">Josh</a> did at that Maker&#39;s place?&quot; So I caught up with Josh who raved
about his experience, the atmosphere and the amount he learned. I showed the
course to my other dev friends. They hadn&#39;t heard of Makers, but were generally
impressed by the programme. One expressed concern about the Ruby/Rails focus, in
a world where <a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a> was becoming the next big thing. They suggested
I ask the question.</p>

<p>So I wrote a short email to Makers, saying - &#39;hey, why Rails?&#39; And I got a well
thought out, well written, extensive email in reply, arguing that, yes, Node was
important, but that Makers teachers how to be a developer in a culture/method
sense of that word, and that Rails was just a good platform to start from - not
the be all and end all.</p>

<p>Cost was of course an issue - nobody spends the best part of £10,000 pounds on
a whim. And if I could achieve the same results just through educating myself
the Makers experience would be pointless. But I know a few things about myself:</p>

<ol>
<li>I <em>like</em> difficult things</li>
<li>I work in intense bursts</li>
<li>I work best under pressure</li>
<li>I prefer to be in a gang working towards the same goal</li>
</ol>

<p>I know that I&#39;d work best with a goal, in an immersive environment, surrounded
by bloody clever people all working towards the same thing and supporting each
other. It&#39;s what saw me through University. I took particular note of <a href="http://www.startuprob.com/learn-to-code/">this
article</a> by one of the co-founders of Makers, <a href="https://twitter.com/startuprob">Rob Johnson</a>.
I also knew that I couldn&#39;t hang around, that if this was the right decision
then it was the right decision <em>now</em>, and it had to happen as quickly and
efficiently as possible.</p>

<p>I looked at other other bootcamps, mainly <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/london">General Assembly</a>, who definitely
have scale and experience on their side. But I was sold on Makers after spending
some time with the other finalists of the <a href="http://blog.skimlinks.com/2014/03/12/skimlinkstomakers-competition-introducing-the-finalists/">#SkimlinksToMakers</a> competition
during the final interviews, and at the Makers open days. Meeting the
instructors (I especially remember talking with <a href="https://twitter.com/rubenkostucki">Ruben</a> - and a slightly
confusing attempt to talk with passion about <em>Person of Interest</em>, the Turing
test, chess and some other things. Enthusiastic, yes. Coherent...?). I also read
the (numerous) blogs of former students - I found <a href="http://davewood.me/blog/2014/01/18/makers-academy-rewound/">Dave Wood</a>&#39;s
description pretty exciting and useful, and of course <a href="http://jamesjoshuahill.tumblr.com/">Josh</a>&#39;s. I also
had a forty-minute phone conversation with <a href="https://twitter.com/JordanPoulton">Jordan</a> (he sent the great
email), who again answered all my questions in an open, non-salesy way. He&#39;d
<a href="http://www.jordanpoulton.com/blog/makers-academy-12-hours-to-lift-off/">done the course himself</a>, which gave a unique perspective, and
spent at least ten minutes trying to put me off.</p>

<p>He failed. I applied. The interview went well (Jordan again - felt like he was
stalking me...), although it was far from a push over (it&#39;s amazing how difficult
basic maths when someone&#39;s looking over your shoulder - and a US keyboard
layout threw me for at least a minute...). But I left wanting to get in more
than ever, and did a (pretty big) whoop of joy when I received the email telling
me that I had been accepted.</p>

<p>So here I am, feeling pretty ready. Nervous, and excited. I&#39;ve studied some of
the basics as hard as I could, know more about Ruby than I did six months ago,
and eager for more. I&#39;m really looking forward to learning something new
everyday. First step is meeting the rest of my cohort this Friday (exciting!). I&#39;ll be
blogging as I go along (probably nowhere near as extensively as this), just to
keep a record on how I&#39;m doing.</p>

<p>But, so far, it looks like this is my best New Year&#39;s resolution. Ever.</p>

      <a href="/2014/07/18/ruby_enumerable_returns/">
        Many Enumerable Returns
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Jul 2014</span>

    <p>As threatened then, here&#39;s the followup to my <a href="/2014/07/12/destructuring/">last post</a> on the
<code>#Enumerables</code> section from <a href="https://rubymonk.com/">Ruby Monk</a>, how I felt like a bit of an
idiot for a few hours, and what I learned from that.</p>

<p>tl;dr - enumerable blocks aren&#39;t magic; <code>yield</code> is magic.</p>

<p>This question is a little further along from the last, and was framed so:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Try implementing a method called occurrences that accepts a string argument and
uses inject to build a Hash. The keys of this hash should be unique words from
that string. The value of those keys should be the number of times this word
appears in that string.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So far so, so good. So I wrote this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">occurrences</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">str</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">str</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">scan</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/\w+/</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">inject</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">Hash</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">hashy</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">|</span>
    <span class="n">hashy</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">downcase</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Which spat out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>TypeError
can&#39;t convert String into Integer</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And left me confused for a good few minutes. OK, getting on for a quarter of an
hour. What was going on? - what I&#39;d written was very similar to the example
above:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">15</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">16</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">23</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">42</span><span class="o">].</span><span class="n">inject</span><span class="p">({})</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">update</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>So I caved and looked at the answer:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">occurrences</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">str</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">str</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">scan</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/\w+/</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">inject</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">Hash</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">build</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">word</span><span class="o">|</span>
        <span class="n">build</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">word</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">downcase</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">+=</span><span class="mi">1</span>
        <span class="n">build</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Which left me none the wiser. Why was the block re-iterating the accumulator
function at the end? To test this I played around with <code>p</code>-ing the lines of the
block... and discovered something interesting. Namely,</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">update</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># =&gt; a</span>

<span class="c1"># But...</span>

<span class="n">build</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">word</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">downcase</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">+=</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="c1"># =&gt; build[word.downcase], the new value of that key</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The block <em>needs to return the accumulator</em> - the first example is just lucky
that it does so already!</p>

<p>The only reason the accumulator in an <code>Enumerable#inject</code> accumulates is that
<em>it&#39;s returned from the block on each iteration</em>. In other words, somewhere in
the definition of <code>#inject</code> for each class that can be made enumerable, the
method <code>yield</code>s to the block, and then keeps the value returned to be passed in
again as the new accumulator argument.</p>

<p>I&#39;d previously thought of <code>#inject</code> as working by <em>magic</em>, whereas in fact it
was working by a method I could probably write myself given enough time.
Something like this...</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">bob</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="o">]</span>

<p>I relied on <code>#each</code> here, but we could easily write an <code>each</code> method using
a <code>for... in...</code> loop or similar. The genius is in <code>yield</code>, which is the <em>real
magic</em> that&#39;s going on here.</p>

<p><a href="https://rubymonk.com/">Ruby Monk</a> has more about the <a href="http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1/chapters/34-lambdas-and-blocks-in-ruby/lessons/78-blocks-in-ruby">magic of yield</a>, and why it&#39;s
weird in a language that professes that everything is an object. Like a lot in
Ruby, I discovered a small thing didn&#39;t work, patiently played with it until
I found out why, and then &#39;worked&#39; that small new piece of knowledge to give me
greater insight into what was going on. I&#39;m finding this to be the most
satisfying method to learn by, both because it makes me feel like I&#39;m learning
to a deeper degree than I would by just reading the answers out of a book, and
in addition, when the books do cover the subject, I can better apply what&#39;s
written there to what I&#39;ve seen in action.</p>

<h3><em>postscipt</em> - 27/714</h3>

<p>Of course, David Black covers the same ground, but better (gets <code>each</code> off the
ground using a <code>for</code> loop), in chapter 6 of <a href="http://www.manning.com/black2/"><em>The Well Grounded Rubyist</em></a>. Love that
book.</p>

      <a href="/2014/07/12/destructuring/">
        Destructuring in a Method Block
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Jul 2014</span>

    <p>I went from genius to idiot - very rapidly - when looking at Enumerable#map and
#inject in <a href="https://rubymonk.com/">Ruby Monk</a>, a free resource to help learn ruby that I&#39;ve
found really useful. Let&#39;s start with &#39;genius&#39; (although not really genius, more
wrong but lucky).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://rubymonk.com/learning/books/4-ruby-primer-ascent/chapters/44-collections/lessons/98-iterate-filtrate-and-transform#solution4313">question</a> was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Exploit the fact that map always returns an array: write a method <code>hash_keys</code>
that accepts a hash and maps over it to return all the keys in a linear Array.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exciting, right?</p>

<p>The solution that RM gave was this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hash_keys</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">hash</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="nb">hash</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">map</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">pair</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">pair</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">first</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>But I went for:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hash_keys</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">hash</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="nb">hash</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">map</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">key</span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Not much difference, but enough. I had become confused when I entered my code,
thinking more about the <code>each_with_index</code> method mentioned in the same page
above. I was forgetting that <code>#map</code> would be sending back a single value, an
array of the key-value pair. Ruby Monk&#39;s solution used that fact to use the
method <code>#first</code> on the array, to get the first element (the key) out.</p>

<p>But, by chance, my solution worked - it split the array by telling the
block for map that it would be getting two arguments - checking with the good
people on the #ruby channel on IRC (a chap called bannisterfiend to be precise),
this is <a href="http://tony.pitluga.com/2011/08/08/destructuring-with-ruby.html"><em>destructuring</em></a>, binding a set of values to
a corresponding set of values that you can normally bind to a single variable
(that&#39;s the definition as given in <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/clm/node252.html">Common Lisp</a>, but makes sense here).</p>

<p>What we&#39;re seeing is this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">]</span>
<span class="n">x</span> <span class="c1"># =&gt; 1</span>
<span class="n">y</span> <span class="c1"># =&gt; 2</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>But done as a loop for all the arrays pulled out of the hash by <code>#map</code>. Tony
Pitluga sings the praises of destructuring block arguments (which is what this
is) in his longer article on <a href="http://tony.pitluga.com/2011/08/08/destructuring-with-ruby.html">destructuring in Ruby</a>.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an improvement in the semantics of the method (would you rather have
<code>key</code> or <code>pair.first</code>?) and a saving of writing/time in any later work you might
want to do on the values. Of course, we wouldn&#39;t want to do this to longer
arrays - too many elements to bind to values.</p>

<p>Unless we used the &#39;unarray&#39; or, &#39;star&#39; or (best name evar) <a href="http://endofline.wordpress.com/2011/01/21/the-strange-ruby-splat/">splat
operator</a> to collect some of the other elements.</p>

<p>Consider:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="n">j</span>
<span class="n">x</span> <span class="c1"># =&gt; 1</span>
<span class="n">y</span> <span class="c1"># =&gt; [2,3,4,5,6]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>There&#39;s a lot more on the magic of the splat in the second edition of <a href="http://www.manning.com/black2/">The Well
Rounded Rubyist</a> which has just been published (and which I&#39;m enjoying
immensely).</p>

<p>OK, I&#39;ll write up my other mistake (the one that broke the <code>#map</code> block) later in
the week.</p>

<p>PS - noticed when getting links for this post that Ruby 2.0 introduces the
double-splat operator for <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18289152/what-does-double-splat-operators-do-in-ruby">turning keyword-value pairs in argument lists into
a hash</a>. Which is also exciting.</p>
