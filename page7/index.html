        Rails for Zombies
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 May 2014</span>

    <p>Just been looking at <a href="http://railsforzombies.org/">Rails for Zombies</a> again in preparation for my
forthcoming interview with <a href="http://railsforzombies.org/">Makers Academy</a> (because it’s never too late and
you can always do more).</p>

<p>It strikes me what a difference a few months of Ruby and a course redesign
makes. Now when faced with the first set of exercises I wasn’t, as before,
struggling to keep up and make sense. Instead I was interrogating what was going
on - “Wait, <code>Zombie.find(1)</code> - what’s it finding? Capital Z… is it a class?
Let’s find out <code>Zombie.class =&gt; Class</code>  - cool, so the tables are represented by
different classes in Ruby… what sort of methods does a Zombie have anyway?
<code>Zombie.find(1).methods</code>…” and so on.</p>

<p>This was great - using the techniques I’d picked up from Ruby Monk and Ruby
Koans to work out for myself what was going on (and not have an instructor tell
me). By the end of the course (and the first part of the sequel) I had suddenly
gained an insight not only into what Rails can do, but how it does it, and why
it does it the way it does. I could also see what MVC was, not just as a theory
but literally in the code - this is the controller, this is a model.</p>

<p>The guys at <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/">Codeschool</a> have changed the course since my first attempt at
it — they describe it as Rails for Zombies: Redux — and it’s a huge improvement.
Definitely worth a look. And it’s FREE!</p>

        Late in the day Linux
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 Apr 2014</span>

    <p>Late in the day yesterday I finally decided that I wanted — no, I needed — to
install Linux. There are a few reasons for this:</p>

<ul>
<li>I can’t afford a Mac.</li>
<li>I need to familiarize myself with the *nix CLI.</li>
<li>I’m tired of the grinding noises that Windows 7 makes.</li>
<li>Nobody will buy me a Mac.</li>
<li>I’m also sick of every damn tutorial I read seeming to be geared up or an OS
X or Linux machine.</li>
<li>Excitement and adventure, fortune and glory — as always.</li>
<li>And the lack of Mac.</li>
<li>(Seriously, I’m beginning to suspect that Mac envy is a disease… I’m not proud
of myself)</li>
</ul>

<p>The last time I tried to do this was back in around 2005 or 6, when I was
dipping my toes into the open source waters to see what could happen. And I was
relatively underwhelmed. Not only did I have no idea what I was doing, but there
didn’t seem to be much to do. I’d installed watever version of Ubuntu was around
on a partition on my old whatever version of Windows PC. I was impressed that it
worked, that it all came together - but then was left struggling over issues of
compatibility of certain bits of hardware - I remember something to do with the
WiFi… and then at the end of it all I still had something which wasn’t quite as
good as XP, and I had no reason to stay around.</p>

<p>Well, see above for reasons to stay around this time. And how’s the experience
second time around? In a word: flawless. I went with <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>, threw it
onto partition and waited to see what happened. The installation compared
favourably with every Windows installation I’ve ever done (a few by now), it
reached out to my home Wifi to update itself, it recommended some packages to
install. Bliss. The interface is prettier that I could ever have imagined.</p>

<p>And the other difference from ten years or so ago: applications. There are
actual, genuine, real things for me to use. not just web apps — threw Chrome on
pretty sharpish though and everything I have set up there synchronized neatly
— but the new versions of LibreOffice look to be more than enough for what I’ll
ever need, Dropbox dropped in well — heck, there’s even Steam. Steam! It was all
I could do not play Super Hexagon all afternoon.</p>

<p>Finally, the juiciness of all that fun developer-oriented functionality that
comes out of the box (or just within reach). The command line just pops up,
things run from the command line — it’s much easier to get my head around.</p>

<p>So if you’re a little scared of Linux, or perhaps are a little twice-shy like
I was, don’t be. It’s a different, and beautiful, beast out there.</p>

<p>Now, on to install Rails 4.0.whatever it is right now!</p>
