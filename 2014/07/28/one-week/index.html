  <h1 class="post-title">One week to go</h1>
  <span class="post-date">28 Jul 2014</span>
  <p>For those who know me, or have been following my <a href="https://twitter.com/gypsydave5">Twitter feed</a>, you may
know that I&#39;ll be starting at <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/">Makers Academy</a> on the 4th of August.
That&#39;s in a week&#39;s time. Part of the reason I&#39;ve been keeping this blog is to
monitor my progress in preparing for that day.</p>

<p>So, why Makers?</p>

<p>My New Year&#39;s resolution was to change my life (aren&#39;t they always?). I didn&#39;t
want to spend the next thirty-plus years working in a career I was adequately
suited for (marketing) and being the guy in the department who got to do all the
maths-y/computery stuff while not being at all enthusiastic about... well, about
everything else he was doing. At the time I was having a terrible time in my job</p>

<p>I sought advice from everyone I knew, and talked incessantly about software
development with anyone who would listen. I&#39;m blessed with good, patient friends
who were happy to put up with this, a number of who work in the industry
already. They&#39;ve steered me and mentored me over the last few months
(specifically <a href="https://twitter.com/shapeshed">@shapeshed</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/asbrookes">@asbrookes</a>), shown me where
<a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">codecademy</a> was, and generally answered any of my questions.  I recognised
that this career change was going to work - the more I learned the more I wanted
to learn, and the more there was to learn the more a learned (a happy virtuous
circle). An interest in tech and programming became a passion (my partner can
attest to this - barely an evening without being glued to the laptop, tapping
away).  I became confident in my decision.</p>

<p>I mentioned my intentions to my friend Mike. &quot;Oh,&quot; he said, &quot;sort of like what
<a href="https://twitter.com/jamesjoshuahill">Josh</a> did at that Maker&#39;s place?&quot; So I caught up with Josh who raved
about his experience, the atmosphere and the amount he learned. I showed the
course to my other dev friends. They hadn&#39;t heard of Makers, but were generally
impressed by the programme. One expressed concern about the Ruby/Rails focus, in
a world where <a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a> was becoming the next big thing. They suggested
I ask the question.</p>

<p>So I wrote a short email to Makers, saying - &#39;hey, why Rails?&#39; And I got a well
thought out, well written, extensive email in reply, arguing that, yes, Node was
important, but that Makers teachers how to be a developer in a culture/method
sense of that word, and that Rails was just a good platform to start from - not
the be all and end all.</p>

<p>Cost was of course an issue - nobody spends the best part of Â£10,000 pounds on
a whim. And if I could achieve the same results just through educating myself
the Makers experience would be pointless. But I know a few things about myself:</p>

<ol>
<li>I <em>like</em> difficult things</li>
<li>I work in intense bursts</li>
<li>I work best under pressure</li>
<li>I prefer to be in a gang working towards the same goal</li>
</ol>

<p>I know that I&#39;d work best with a goal, in an immersive environment, surrounded
by bloody clever people all working towards the same thing and supporting each
other. It&#39;s what saw me through University. I took particular note of <a href="http://www.startuprob.com/learn-to-code/">this
article</a> by one of the co-founders of Makers, <a href="https://twitter.com/startuprob">Rob Johnson</a>.
I also knew that I couldn&#39;t hang around, that if this was the right decision
then it was the right decision <em>now</em>, and it had to happen as quickly and
efficiently as possible.</p>

<p>I looked at other other bootcamps, mainly <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/london">General Assembly</a>, who definitely
have scale and experience on their side. But I was sold on Makers after spending
some time with the other finalists of the <a href="http://blog.skimlinks.com/2014/03/12/skimlinkstomakers-competition-introducing-the-finalists/">#SkimlinksToMakers</a> competition
during the final interviews, and at the Makers open days. Meeting the
instructors (I especially remember talking with <a href="https://twitter.com/rubenkostucki">Ruben</a> - and a slightly
confusing attempt to talk with passion about <em>Person of Interest</em>, the Turing
test, chess and some other things. Enthusiastic, yes. Coherent...?). I also read
the (numerous) blogs of former students - I found <a href="http://davewood.me/blog/2014/01/18/makers-academy-rewound/">Dave Wood</a>&#39;s
description pretty exciting and useful, and of course <a href="http://jamesjoshuahill.tumblr.com/">Josh</a>&#39;s. I also
had a forty-minute phone conversation with <a href="https://twitter.com/JordanPoulton">Jordan</a> (he sent the great
email), who again answered all my questions in an open, non-salesy way. He&#39;d
<a href="http://www.jordanpoulton.com/blog/makers-academy-12-hours-to-lift-off/">done the course himself</a>, which gave a unique perspective, and
spent at least ten minutes trying to put me off.</p>

<p>He failed. I applied. The interview went well (Jordan again - felt like he was
stalking me...), although it was far from a push over (it&#39;s amazing how difficult
basic maths when someone&#39;s looking over your shoulder - and a US keyboard
layout threw me for at least a minute...). But I left wanting to get in more
than ever, and did a (pretty big) whoop of joy when I received the email telling
me that I had been accepted.</p>

<p>So here I am, feeling pretty ready. Nervous, and excited. I&#39;ve studied some of
the basics as hard as I could, know more about Ruby than I did six months ago,
and eager for more. I&#39;m really looking forward to learning something new
everyday. First step is meeting the rest of my cohort this Friday (exciting!). I&#39;ll be
blogging as I go along (probably nowhere near as extensively as this), just to
keep a record on how I&#39;m doing.</p>

<p>But, so far, it looks like this is my best New Year&#39;s resolution. Ever.</p>
