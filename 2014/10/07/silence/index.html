  <h1 class="post-title">Silence is the Enemy</h1>
  <span class="post-date">07 Oct 2014</span>
  <p>I&#39;ve been thinking about this post for a few weeks, but <a href="@benjilanyado">Benji
Lanyado</a> from <a href="https://www.picfair.com/">Picfair</a> has just given
a great talk about starting his business. Great for a number of reasons (he&#39;s
a very charismatic speaker to begin with), but the key thing I&#39;m taking home
with me is what he&#39;s just said about, well - talking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Talk to everyone. Get out of your flat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s easy to forget that in a few weeks I&#39;m not going to be around here at
Makers. And that the best thing - the <em>best</em> thing - about being here is talking
to people.</p>

<p>At every stage of coding - whether in solving a problem, learning a language,
fixing a bug - silence is the enemy. You know your pairing is going wrong when
nobody is saying anything. Say <em>something</em>, even if you&#39;re just restating the
problem. Pairing is made to make you talk about what&#39;s going on - making your
brain work around the problem by putting it in your mouth. How incredible is
that?</p>

<p>This becomes really apparent when you&#39;ve been coding on your own for
a while. You tend to find yourself going crazy over small bugs that are really
apparent when you&#39;re looking at them in someone else&#39;s code. This is why <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RubberDucking">rubber
ducking</a> happens - that experience you&#39;ve
had of going to someone for help and suddenly realizing the solution halfway
through explaing the problem to them - they&#39;ve become your rubber duck (remember
to thank them with a quack).</p>

<p>Same goes for teaching - the number of things I&#39;ve got down solidly by having to
explain it to someone, out loud. It&#39;s mind blowing. You can&#39;t skip over anything
when you&#39;re talking, your brain can&#39;t trick you into false confidence by waving
its hands over a bit you don&#39;t understand. I gave a talk about bitwise operators
a few days ago - I thought I had it all covered, but when I got a question about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two&#x27;s_complement">two&#39;s complement</a> it became
<em>really</em> apparent that I didn&#39;t have a clue. Embarassing? Yes, a little - but
now at least I know where I&#39;m ignorant, rather than being surprised about it
later.</p>

<p>Silence is the enemy of good and happy coding. Keep talking - even if it&#39;s just
to yourself.</p>
