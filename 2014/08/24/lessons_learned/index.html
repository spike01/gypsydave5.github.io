  <p>Things I&#39;ve learned so far from my teachers:</p>

<h3><a href="https://twitter.com/Stephen_lloyd">Stephen</a> - Succinct Semantics</h3>

<p>I felt a little smug about my code when Steve sat next to me to see how I was
doing. I was seeing if there were any broken bikes in an array, something like</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">bikes</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">select</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">bike</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">bike</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">broken?</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">count</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>He took a quick look and pointed out that this was a little on the long side.
Does Ruby have an <code>any?</code> method for <code>Array</code>s? Sure enough, there in <code>Enumerable</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">bikes</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">any?</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">bike</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">bike</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">broken?</span><span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Better. I would have been happy. But Steve then says, try passing a the symbol
for <code>broken?</code> as a proc - something I&#39;d seen and not used.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">bikes</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">any?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="ss">:broken?</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>See how that&#39;s better? It says exactly what it does? Yes, I did. And I&#39;d learned
that you don&#39;t have to sacrifice succinctness to semantics and vice versa. Ruby
has enough well-named methods and techniques to create a short statement that
someone who didn&#39;t know Ruby would still understand. Lesson learned.</p>

<h3><a href="https://twitter.com/liviu_23">Mihai</a> - Delete Your Code</h3>

<p>I asked Mihai for some help changing my tests for the Boris Bikes project. I was
trying to change the RSpec tests I&#39;d written from <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/123627/what-are-the-london-and-chicago-schools-of-tdd">Chicago to London
style</a> having just been shown how to do doubles.</p>

<p>Start again, Mihai said. Don&#39;t be precious or treasure what you&#39;ve written
- just get rid of it and start again. You&#39;ll learn more that way.</p>

<p>Since then I&#39;ve taken immense pleasure in wiping entire projects out. And
learned more by doing that. Lesson learned.</p>

<h3><a href="https://twitter.com/ecomba">Enrique</a> - Cooking without ever having have Eaten</h3>

<p>Late in the day I asked Enrique about program design. I was worried, really
worried, that I didn&#39;t know the right way to proceed with writing a program.
He&#39;d just introduced the idea of design patterns that day, so I asked him to
recommend a book, or a checklist, or a mantra - the best way to learn some
patterns.</p>

<p>Even as I spoke, Enrique started moving him hands, miming typing in front of me.
Remember what I said earlier, he said, about coding being entirely artificial.
It&#39;s not like cooking where you know what food is and what it tastes like. It&#39;s
like cooking when you&#39;ve never eaten food, have no idea what good or bad food
tastes like. The only way you&#39;ll learn is by writing code, a lot of code. Then
your instincts, your taste and intuition, will improve.</p>

<p>It was only later that I connected this advice up with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Bergson#Creativity">Bergson&#39;s ideas about
creativity, specifically the swimming example</a>. You wouldn&#39;t think
a person could swim if you only ever saw them walk, the argument goes. For
swimming to be intellectually comprehendable, you&#39;ve got to throw yourself in
the water first. You can&#39;t theorize about things you haven&#39;t done - intuition
must take the lead, intelligence is a not a speculative faculty, but a practical one.</p>

<p>Mind blown, I staggered home, ignored <em>The RSpec Book</em> and wrote more code.
Lesson learned.</p>
