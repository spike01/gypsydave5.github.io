  <h1 class="post-title">Book Review: Computer Science Programming Basics in Ruby</h1>
  <span class="post-date">14 Dec 2014</span>
  <p>I recently finished reading <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028192.do">Computer Science Programming Basics in Ruby</a> by
Ophir Frieder, Gideon Frieder and David Grossman. I was looking for something
that would extend my knowledge of computer science fundamentals - the title
appealed a I&#39;ve done the majority of my coding up to this point in Ruby, so
I was hoping the familiar language would allow me to concentrate more on the
computer science theory.</p>

<p>I was ultimately disappointed - the book isn&#39;t so much a computer science primer
as a programming primer. The concepts being taught in this book tend to be basic
ones - control flow, simple data structures, how a computer works. It&#39;s pitched
at an entry level, and for that I&#39;m sure it&#39;s ideal, but it&#39;s not quite what
I was after.</p>

<p>Idiomatic Ruby is avoided in the book in favour of using patterns that are more
generic to all programming languages. This is a good idea as it introduces core
programming concepts in a non language specific way, but the lack of common Ruby
methods like <code>each</code> might be concerning to some. The book teaches programming
basics in Ruby, but I don&#39;t think it teaches a great deal of Ruby while doing
so.</p>

<p>That said I learned a great deal in Chapter 7, Sorting and Searching. The
comparison of different search and sort algorithms make a good introduction to
algorithms in general and made me think a bit harder about the magic that goes
on under the hood of Ruby methods and operators that I take for granted. I&#39;m
going to try and learn more about algorithms in the next few weeks (see my <a href="/2014/12/08/exposing-myself/">last
post</a> for the rest of my hit list).</p>

<p>Maybe borrow this book from the library and give it a skim read if you&#39;re
already familiar with Ruby, because I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find some useful stuff there. If
you&#39;re interested in learning Ruby from the ground up you should probably pair
this book with something like <em><a href="http://www.manning.com/black2/">The Well Grounded Rubyist</a></em> in order to see why
Ruby&#39;s so precious and shiny. Otherwise it&#39;s a well structured, detailed and
approachable introductory text, if maybe a touch academic. Just not for me right
now.</p>
